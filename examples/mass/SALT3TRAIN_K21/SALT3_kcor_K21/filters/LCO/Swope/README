The following files contain the scans performed by the TAMU group
(Jean-Philippe Rheault, Jennifer Marshall, Darren Depoy, and Steven Villanueva)
on the Swope Site#3 CCD.  The files correspond to:

{filter}_texas_WLcorr.txt:         Raw optical Telescope+Camera+Filter scans.  
{filter}_texas_SWO.txt:            raw NIR filter scans for Swope (RetroCam)
{filter}_texas_DUP.txt:            raw NIR filter scans for Dupont (WIRC)

{filter}_SWO_TAM_scan_atm.dat:     Final NIR filter scans for Swope (RetroCam)
{filter}_DUP_TAM_scan_atm.dat:     Final NIR filter scans for Dupont (WIRC)
{filter}_tel_ccd_atm_ext_1.2.dat:  Final Swope optical scans
These final fitlers have atmosphere corresponding to 1.2 airmass.
Use these for doing S-corrections, synthetic photometry, etc., etc.

In case they are useful, here are the scans TAMU made of individual components:
Telescope.txt:                     Telescope throughput.
Telescope+Camera.txt:              Telescope and Camera together.

Here are the atmospheric components:
atm_ext_ctio.dat:                  Atmospheric extinction
atm_ext_lines.dat:                 Atmospheric telluric lines

The K filter was abandoned by CSP, but here is a guesstimate of the trhoughput.
kfilter                            Ks filter from Contreras et al. (2010)

Note there are 3 V filters and 2 J filters:

V_LC_3014:   In use up until Jan 13 2006
V_LC_3099:   Jan 14 2006 until Jan 24 2006
V_LC_9844:   Jan 25 2006 until present.
Jrc1:        In use up until Jan 15 2009
Jrc2:        Jan 15 2009 until present

The final filter zero-points are:

filter		zp

u                      12.986

V-3009                 14.388
V-3014                 14.437
Y (RetroCam+Swope)     13.921
Jrc1 (RetroCam+Swope)  13.836
Jrc2 (RetroCam+Swope)  13.836
H (RetroCam+Swope)     13.510
Y (WIRC+duPont)        13.770
J (WIRC+duPont)        13.866
H (WIRC+duPont)        13.502
Ks (Contreras+2010)    11.968

Zero-points are in the sense that 
m = -2.5log10(F) + zp
and
F = \frac{1}{ch} \int S_X f_\lambda \lambda d\lambda
