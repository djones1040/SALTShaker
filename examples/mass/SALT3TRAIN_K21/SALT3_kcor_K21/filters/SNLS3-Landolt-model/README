Note that we used shifted version
of the Landolt filters: -31.484, +8.485, +2.667, +21.609, +11.283 (all
in A). Alex can explain the origin of these shifts. They have the same
BDmags as the Bessell filters.


sux_bessel90.dat
sb_bessel90.dat
si_bessel90.dat
sr_bessel90.dat
sv_bessel90.dat

are from Bessel M. S., PASP 102, 1181-119 (1990), table 2

Following a footnote of Suntzeff et al (1999), and since we
use transmissions in units of ADUs/photon (and not ADU/energy, see README in base directory),
all the previous transmissions were divided by the wavelenght to obtain :

sux.dat
sb.dat
si.dat
sr.dat
sv.dat

Those are the ones used in the FilterWheel.
